# agda-fun

To install on macos you can use homebrew:
```
brew install agda
``` 
Be careful, it installs GHC. Agda is ~100k lines of Haskell code! A proof assistant is a lot of work :)

If installed with brew, use the following to compile (check the version of agda!) 
```
agda --include-path=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/agda/2.6.2.2_1/lib/agda/src --compile talk.agda
```
